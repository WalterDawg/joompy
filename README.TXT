Hi this is Joompy!
A game that runs on the HL2 BETA
Where do you get the beta? HERE! https://hl2-beta.ru/index.php?topic=28551.0
Then you just put it in the beyta's folder and boom! Its in! You can then launch the game through the LeakNet launcher.

If you like the game, found a bug, want to help out, or have cool content, you can join us on the PEEP discord server! (We make games!!!) https://discord.gg/ShwRy6gq49
Joompy is COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE Texture and map files are not obfuscated or deleted, so you can enjoy messing around or searching for secrets...takes some of the fun away though.

If you want to map for Joompy you can use the 'wc.exe' in the Beta's bin folder.
I hope you enjoy this game!
